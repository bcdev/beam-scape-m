<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
    The <em>Scape-M Processing Tool</em> provides an atmospheric correction designed for land surfaces, inland waters
    and coastal water regions. This processor was developed in the frame of the ESA Diversity II project with
    support of L. Guanter (Free University of Berlin) who developed the underlying algorithm.
</p>

<h3>Algorithms</h3>

<p>
    The underlying algorithm is presented in detail in the peer-reviewed publication [1].
